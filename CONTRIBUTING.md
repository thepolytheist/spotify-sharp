# Greetings
I see you're interested in contributing to this silly little project. If you're bored and think you could be of some used, keep reading.
## So you'd like to help out...
I'll be doing most of the grunt work around here as far as implementing major changes. That said, I would like input if you can contribute to any of the following:
* Giving purpose to the CLI project. At the moment, it's just a sandbox for testing implementation.
* Unit testing the API. I have not yet implemented tests, and these will be crucial.
* Performance and abstraction improvements. I've tried to use what I've learned from API and client design to structure this project the right way, but someone with a keen eye might have better insights.
If you can do something out of the above list, please feel free to write up an issue or open a pull request.
### Style
I am doing my best to keep a consistent style in both naming and code structure. Please do your best to follow what's already there.
